# Electricity Load Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts electricity load using time-series machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
Historical electricity consumption data with time-based features.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Time Series Models (ARIMA / LSTM / XGBoost etc.)

## 🚀 Model Approach
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering (lags, rolling mean)
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics (MAE, RMSE)

## 📈 Results
The model achieved accurate forecasting with minimized error.

## 📂 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
